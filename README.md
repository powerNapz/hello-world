Grand Greetings Great day or evening!

I am Napoleon, Idea Developer in many senses seeking to bring life to persons, places, things by and through creative 
arts, content, products and services for others to experience.  
I am An Intellectual Poet, Creative Electronic Arts Producer (music, graphics, video, radio programming), songwriter and vocalist
Always seeking to learn how to better ones' craft, hence the initiative to begin coding.  I have Much Appreciation for
Natural Aspects that appeal to the senses in general.  I seek also to bridge analog to digital platforms, that old methods
and ways of executing tasks can have a future with appropriate means of functionality.  
Simple Articulation is always my goal, so in such I study hard to make certain all aspects and angles 
have appropriate attention which assists in developing the best outcome.
